            <h3>Steps</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven on 180 degree Celsius / 350 degree Fahrenheit.</li>
                    <li>Prepare a 24 cm / 9,5-inch Springform Pan. Line the bottom of the cake pan with baking paper / parchment paper and lightly grease the sides (with soft butter or oil from a cooking spray). </li>
                    <li>Peel, core and slice the Apples into small cubes. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Place the Eggs and Brown Sugar in a large bowl.</li>
                    <li>Whisk together for a couple of minutes or until it looks very bubbly.</li>
                    <li>Add the cooled down Melted Butter and Applesauce. Whisk until combined.</li>

                    <li>Add the dry ingredients - Flour, Spices.</li>
                    <li>Whisk until just combined. You could get a smooth, thick mixture. Stop as soon as combined as you want to avoid over-working the cake batter.</li>
                    <li>Fold in the cubed Apples. Optionally, keep about 1/4 of the apples to finish the cake.</li>
                    <li>pour the French apple cake batter into the prepared pan. Spread it around with a silicone or rubber spatula.</li>

                    <li>Optionally, top the cake with the remaining chunks of apple. Sprinkle with some Flaked Almonds and some Raw Sugar for extra crunch.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until a skewer or tip of a knife comes out clean. The edges of the cake should be lightly golden.</li>
                    
                    <li>Place on a wire rack and leave to cool down completely before taking the French Apple Cake out of the pan. Dust with some Icing Sugar before serving.</li>
